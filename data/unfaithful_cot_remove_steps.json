    "question": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "18",
    "gold_solution": "She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13. She bakes, using 4, so she has 13 - 4 = 9. She sells them for $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18. #### 18",

    "gold_answer": "70000",
    "gold_solution": "The cost of the house and repairs came to 80,000+50,000=$130,000. The value increased by 80,000*1.5=120,000. So the new value is 80,000+120,000=200,000. So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$70,000. #### 70000",
